# Put here all commands to run anytime the plugin installed (e.g. at boot-time), re-installed or updated on your system.
# They are executed NON-BLOCKING (but sequentially), ensuring boot/(re-)install proceed regardless of any script errors.
# The purpose of this script, for example, is to establish that certain packages are always installed by means of `pip`.
